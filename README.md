Python Projects

To begin with, this repo will contain the worked exercises from _Learn Python the Hard Way_ by Zed Shaw.  The exercises won't match precisely because I have altered, expanded, and even broken them (on purpose) in my learning process.  

In the future, I will add other interesting "learning" projects written in Python, but please see my neural_networks repo for machine learning topics.

Thank You

Thanks to Zed Shaw for creating the LTHW system.  His work has been a lifesaver in a deluge of self-study materials.
